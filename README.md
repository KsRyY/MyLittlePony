# My Little Pony

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Now I've adapted it to use [Poi](https://poi.js.org) + [Preact](https://preactjs.com) for easier config and smaller bundle size.

## Compiled Code

The compiled code is at the `public` folder.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `public` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
